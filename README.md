# Cryptography Application

This application demonstrates various cryptographic operations including:
- SHA Hashing (SHA-256, SHA-512)
- AES Symmetric Encryption/Decryption
- RSA Asymmetric Encryption/Decryption

## Setup
1. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

The application provides a command-line interface to:
- Generate hash values using SHA-256/SHA-512
- Encrypt/Decrypt data using AES
- Generate RSA key pairs and perform asymmetric encryption/decryption
